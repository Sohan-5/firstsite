
Interest in photography websites has exploded over the last 10 years, largely thanks to the developments in digital photography. Cameras and computers have become cheaper and more powerful, software more sophistocated and printers can now print photos that are as good (if not better) than anything produced in a chemical darkroom. Now, once youâ€™ve acquired a digital setup, the economic restrictions of film and development costs have been removed and the cost of photography is virtually nil.
